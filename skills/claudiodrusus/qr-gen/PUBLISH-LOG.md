# Publish Log — qr-gen skill

## 2026-02-21 — Publish Attempt

**Status:** ❌ BLOCKED — ClawHub authentication required

### What happened
1. ✅ Skill files verified — `SKILL.md` has proper frontmatter (`name: qr-gen`, `description` with triggers), `scripts/generate_qr.py` present
2. ✅ Publish command prepared: `clawdhub publish ~/shelly/products/skill-1/ --slug qr-gen --name "QR Code Generator" --version 1.0.0 --changelog "Initial release"`
3. ❌ `clawdhub whoami` → "Not logged in"
4. ❌ `clawdhub login` opens GitHub OAuth in browser — requires manual sign-in
5. ❌ Browser automation couldn't complete the GitHub OAuth flow (service timeout)

### Next Steps
1. **Manual login:** Run `clawdhub login` in terminal, sign in with GitHub in the browser that opens
2. **Then publish:**
   ```bash
   clawdhub publish ~/shelly/products/skill-1/ --slug qr-gen --name "QR Code Generator" --version 1.0.0 --changelog "Initial release: Generate QR codes from text, URLs, WiFi, vCards. PNG/SVG/ASCII output."
   ```

### Skill Readiness
The skill itself is ready to publish — SKILL.md frontmatter is correct, script is in place, no issues found.
