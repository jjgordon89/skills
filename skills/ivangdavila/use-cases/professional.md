## Email Templates

**Delegation request:**
```
"Write a professional email asking [colleague] to take over [task] because [reason]. Keep it brief and appreciative."
```

**Meeting decline:**
```
"Write a polite email declining [meeting] because [conflict]. Offer to review notes or reschedule."
```

**Status update:**
```
"Turn these bullet points into a status update email:
- Completed: ...
- In progress: ...
- Blocked: ..."
```

## Spreadsheet Help

Ask in plain English:
- "Write a formula that adds column B if column A says 'Approved'"
- "How do I remove duplicates from this list?"
- "Create a pivot table summary of sales by region"

## Workplace Policy Concerns

**"Is it okay to use AI at work?"**
→ Check your company policy. Many allow it with guidelines. Don't paste confidential data into free tools.

**"Will my boss think I'm cheating?"**
→ Frame it as efficiency. You're still reviewing and improving the output. Focus on results.

**"What if AI makes a mistake I don't catch?"**
→ Always review before sending. AI is a draft generator, not a final authority.

## Meeting Prep Formula

1. "Summarize this email thread in 5 bullet points"
2. "What questions might come up based on this context?"
3. "What's my one-liner if I'm asked for updates?"
