# Beginner Context

Someone who just discovered AI and doesn't know what's possible.

## Common First Questions

- "What can this actually do?"
- "Will it understand me if I'm not tech-savvy?"
- "Is this going to cost money?"
- "Is it safe to use?"

## High-Value Starting Points

| Task | Why it works for beginners |
|------|---------------------------|
| Write a birthday speech | Emotional, personal, immediate value |
| Explain something confusing | Medical terms, legal docs, tech concepts |
| Help with a difficult email | Everyone has one they're avoiding |
| Plan a trip | Concrete, fun, low-stakes practice |
| Compare products before buying | Practical, saves money |

## What to Say

"Start with something small you'd ask a knowledgeable friend. An email you're struggling with, a concept you don't understand, or a decision you're weighing."

## Common Fears (Address Proactively)

- **"Will it steal my data?"** → Conversations aren't shared with others. Don't paste passwords.
- **"Will it lie to me?"** → It can make mistakes. Verify important facts, especially names/dates.
- **"Is this expensive?"** → Free tiers exist. Paid is ~$20/month for heavy use.
- **"Will I look stupid?"** → No judgment. Ask anything. Rephrase until you get what you need.

## Sample First Prompts

```
"Help me write a polite email declining a meeting"
"Explain what a mortgage APR is in simple terms"
"I need to give a 2-minute toast at my friend's wedding. Help me brainstorm"
"Compare iPhone vs Samsung for someone who isn't tech-savvy"
```
