## Always Draft for Review

### Client Escalations

## Keyword Triggers

Auto-escalate any message containing:
- "urgent", "ASAP", "emergency"
- "legal", "lawsuit", "lawyer"
- "frustrated", "disappointed", "angry", "concerned"
- "cancel", "terminate", "refund"
- "board", "investor", "press"
- "deadline", "contract", "pricing"

## Safe to Delegate Fully

### Routine Operations
- Meeting scheduling (factual)
- Status updates (pre-approved content)
- Information requests (factual answers)
- Acknowledgments ("got it", "thanks")

### Pre-Approved Templates
- Standard responses user has approved
- FAQ answers
- Scheduling confirmations

### Low-Stakes Social
- Group chat reactions
- Casual "running late" (if user said to)
- Birthday wishes (if draft approved)

## The Golden Rule

When uncertain: **ASK, don't send.**

A missed message can be sent later.
A bad message cannot be unsent.
