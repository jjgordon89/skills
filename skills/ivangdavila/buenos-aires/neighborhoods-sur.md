## San Telmo - Bohemian Heart

Buenos Aires' oldest residential neighborhood. Tango milongas, antique markets, and cobblestone streets.

### Overview

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Character | 5/5 | Most atmospheric barrio |
| Walkability | 4/5 | Cobblestones can be rough |
| Restaurants | 4/5 | Mix of tourist and local |
| Nightlife | 4/5 | Tango, bars, live music |
| Safety Day | 4/5 | Good with awareness |
| Safety Night | 3/5 | Stick to main streets |
| Transit | 3/5 | Subte C, E |
| Expat Density | Medium | Artists, dancers |

### The Character

San Telmo is WHERE Buenos Aires' tango culture lives. Not the tourist show version-the real milongas, the dance halls, the musicians playing in plazas.

**Architecture:** Colonial buildings, interior patios, exposed brick. Many buildings are 150+ years old.

**Vibe:** Bohemian, artistic, slightly gritty. Think Brooklyn before gentrification or Paris' Montmartre.

### Rent (monthly, blue rate)

| Type | Range USD |
|------|-----------|
| Studio | $280-380 |
| 1BR | $350-500 |
| 2BR | $450-700 |
| 3BR | $600-900 |

**Note:** Buildings often have character but lack modern amenities. Heating may be limited.

### Key Areas

**Plaza Dorrego** - Heart of San Telmo. Sunday antique market (Feria de San Telmo). Surrounded by cafes and tango.

**Defensa** - Main street running through. Antique shops, bars, tourist commerce.

**Mercado de San Telmo** - Historic market building. Fresh produce, coffee, restaurants, some of BA's best food stalls.

**Estados Unidos** - Street with many residences, quieter than Defensa.

### Sunday Market

The Feria de San Telmo transforms the neighborhood every Sunday:
- Plaza Dorrego + Defensa street
- 10am-5pm approximately
- Antiques, crafts, street performers
- Extremely crowded
- Pickpockets active-be careful

If you LIVE here, Sundays are either your favorite day or your worst. Plan accordingly.

## La Boca - Tourist Zone & Beyond

Famous for colorful houses, Caminito, and Boca Juniors football. But understanding La Boca requires knowing its reality.

### The Truth About La Boca

**Caminito Area (Tourist):**
- Colorful painted houses
- Tango shows
- Souvenir shops
- Restaurants (overpriced, tourist quality)
- Safe during daytime
- NOT safe after dark

**Rest of La Boca (Local):**
- Working-class neighborhood
- Port workers, families
- NOT a tourist area
- NOT safe for wandering foreigners
- Genuine but rough

### Overview (Caminito Area Only)

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Tourist Appeal | 4/5 | Instagram-famous |
| Authenticity | 2/5 | Very staged |
| Safety Day | 4/5 | Police presence |
| Safety Night | 1/5 | Leave before dark |
| Food Quality | 2/5 | Tourist traps |
| Transit | 2/5 | Bus only, no subte |

### Visiting Caminito

**Do:**
- Go during daylight (10am-4pm best)
- Take a taxi/Uber directly there
- Stay within the painted streets
- Watch tango dancers (tip if you photograph)
- Visit La Bombonera (Boca Juniors stadium)

**Don't:**
- Walk from San Telmo (sketchy route)
- Stay after dark
- Wander beyond the tourist area
- Eat at restaurants there (tourist traps)
- Flash expensive belongings

### Living in La Boca?

**Short answer:** No.

**Longer answer:** Unless you're Argentine, have family there, or have very specific reasons (working at the port, etc.), there's no reason for an expat to live in La Boca. It's:
- Unsafe for foreigners not familiar with the area
- Far from everything
- No subte access
- No expat community
- No coworking or remote work infrastructure

### La Bombonera (Boca Juniors Stadium)

One of the most passionate football experiences in the world.

**Visiting:**
- Stadium tours available
- Museum worth seeing
- Matches: incredibly atmospheric but tickets hard to get
- Superclasico (Boca vs River): bucket list but very difficult to attend

**Warning:** Match days = chaos in the entire area. Plan transport carefully.
