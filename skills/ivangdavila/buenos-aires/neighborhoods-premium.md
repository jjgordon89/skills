## Puerto Madero - The Manhattan of Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires' newest and most modern neighborhood. Redeveloped docks transformed into luxury towers, waterfront dining, and corporate headquarters.

### Overview

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Safety | 5/5 | Safest in BA |
| Modern Amenities | 5/5 | Newest buildings |
| Waterfront | 5/5 | Only true waterfront |
| Walkability | 3/5 | Long distances |
| Restaurants | 4/5 | Upscale, limited variety |
| Nightlife | 2/5 | Dead at night |
| Transit | 2/5 | Limited, car recommended |
| Character | 2/5 | Generic modern |
| Expat Density | Medium | Corporate expats |

### The Reality

Puerto Madero is Buenos Aires trying to be Miami or Singapore. It works for:
- Corporate executives on expense accounts
- Safety-obsessed newcomers
- Those who prefer modern over character

It fails for:
- Anyone wanting "Buenos Aires character"
- Budget-conscious people
- Those wanting walkable dining variety
- Night owls (everything closes early)
- Those without cars

### Rent (monthly, blue rate)

| Type | Range USD |
|------|-----------|
| Studio | $600-800 |

| 2BR | $1,200-1,800 |
| 3BR | $1,800-3,000 |
| Penthouse | $3,000-8,000+ |

**Context:** 2-3x the price of similar size in Palermo, for less character.
