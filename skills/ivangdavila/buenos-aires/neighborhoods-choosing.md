## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Choosing Microcentro "Because It's Central"

**Why people do it:** It's literally downtown, must be best location.

**Reality:** Dead after 7pm, unsafe at night, no residential services.

**Better choice:** San Telmo (same price, more character), Villa Crespo (better value)

### Mistake 2: Puerto Madero "For Safety"

**Why people do it:** It's the safest, newest area.

**Reality:** Yes, but isolated, boring, expensive, need car.

**Better choice:** Recoleta (safe + character), Belgrano (safe + livable)

### Mistake 3: Cheapest Option in Rough Area

**Why people do it:** Save money.

**Reality:** Constant stress, safety incidents, no quality of life.

**Better choice:** Pay 20% more for Caballito/Almagro over Constitucion/Once

### Mistake 4: Palermo Soho for Long-Term

**Why people do it:** Best neighborhood in BA.

**Reality:** Tourist prices, crowded, noisy weekends.

**Better choice:** Villa Crespo (same access, 30% cheaper), Palermo Hollywood (less tourist)

### Mistake 5: Near Work Only

**Why people do it:** Short commute.

**Reality:** BA commutes are short anyway. Living in Microcentro to work there = miserable life.

**Better choice:** Prioritize quality of life. 20-30 min commute is nothing.

## Rental Process Tips

### Finding Apartments

| Platform | Type | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| ZonaProp | Local listings | Long-term, Spanish speakers |
| Argenprop | Local listings | Long-term |
| Properati | Local listings | Long-term |
| Airbnb | Short-term | First 1-3 months |
| Facebook groups | Both | Expat community |
| Craigslist BA | Both | Expats, English listings |

### What to Know

1. **Garantia (Guarantee):** Traditional rentals require Argentine property as guarantee OR garantia bancaria (expensive). Foreigners often can't meet this.

2. **Temporary contracts:** Easier for foreigners. Usually furnished, 3-12 months.

3. **Payment:** Increasingly in USD (blue rate) for expats. Traditional in pesos.

4. **Deposits:** Usually 1-2 months rent.

5. **Utilities:** Often not included. Ask specifically.

### Red Flags

- Asking for payment before viewing
- No garantia requirement on long-term (might be scam)
- Price way below market
- Won't video call if you're abroad
- Only accepts Western Union/crypto (scam)
