## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# One-command install (clones repo, detects GPU, sets up everything)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daMustermann/claw-qwen3-tts/main/install.sh)

# Or install from ClawHub
claw install daMustermann/claw-qwen3-tts

# Or clone manually
git clone https://github.com/daMustermann/claw-qwen3-tts.git ~/clawd/skills/qwen3-tts
bash ~/clawd/skills/qwen3-tts/install.sh
```

The installer auto-detects your GPU, creates an isolated Python virtual environment, and installs all dependencies. First run takes 5–15 minutes.

### Speech Generation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "custom-voice-1.7b",
    "input": "Hello, this is a test of the Qwen3 text-to-speech system.",
    "voice": "default",
    "speaker": "Chelsie",
    "language": "en",
    "instruct": "Speak warmly and cheerfully",
    "response_format": "wav"
  }' \
  --output speech.wav
```

### Voice Design

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/voice-design \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "voice-design",
    "input": "Welcome to our podcast!",
    "voice_description": "A warm, deep male voice with a slight British accent, calm and authoritative",
    "language": "en",
    "response_format": "wav"
  }' \
  --output designed_voice.wav
```

### Voice Cloning

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/voice-clone \
  -F "reference_audio=@/path/to/reference.wav" \
  -F "reference_text=Transcript of the reference audio" \
  -F "input=New text to speak in the cloned voice" \
  -F "language=en" \
  -F "response_format=wav" \
  --output cloned.wav
```

- Minimum **3 seconds** of reference audio (10–30 seconds recommended)
- Accurate transcription of reference audio improves quality
- Supports **cross-language cloning** (clone from English → speak in Japanese)

## 🗣️ Voice Persistence

Every designed or cloned voice can be saved with a name you choose:

```
User: "Design a voice — a raspy pirate captain"
Agent: [generates audio] "Would you like to save this voice? What should I call it?"
User: "Call it Captain Hook"
Agent: "Voice saved as 'Captain Hook'! You can use it anytime."

User: "Say 'Ahoy mateys!' with voice Captain Hook"
Agent: [generates using saved voice]
```

Voices are stored locally in `voices/` and persist across sessions. The agent automatically prompts to save after every voice design or clone operation.

---

## 🎭 Built-in Speakers & Instruct

The `custom-voice` models come with **10 built-in speakers**, each with a unique voice:

> Chelsie · Ethan · Aidan · Serena · Ryan · Vivian · Claire · Lucas · Eleanor · Benjamin

You can also control the **emotional tone** with the `instruct` parameter:

```json
{ "instruct": "Speak happily and with excitement" }
{ "instruct": "Whisper softly, as if telling a secret" }
{ "instruct": "用愤怒的语气" }
```

## 🧠 Available Models

| Model ID | HuggingFace ID | Use Case | VRAM |
|----------|----------------|----------|------|
| `custom-voice-0.6b` | `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice` | Fast TTS with built-in speakers | ~2 GB |
| `custom-voice-1.7b` | `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice` | High-quality TTS with built-in speakers | ~5 GB |
| `base-0.6b` | `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base` | Basic TTS (auto-corrected to custom-voice) | ~2 GB |
| `base-1.7b` | `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base` | Basic TTS (auto-corrected to custom-voice) | ~5 GB |
| `voice-design` | `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign` | Voice design from descriptions | ~5 GB |

> **Smart routing:** If you request a `base-*` model on the `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint, the server auto-corrects to the corresponding `custom-voice-*` model to prevent errors.

## 📱 Messaging Integration

### Telegram

Configure your bot token in `config.json`, then the agent sends audio as native PTT voice messages using `sendVoice` (OGG/Opus format).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/send/telegram \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "audio_file": "/path/to/speech.wav",
    "chat_id": "123456789",
    "bot_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
  }'
```

### WhatsApp

Configure your WhatsApp Business API credentials in `config.json`, then audio is sent as native voice messages.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/send/whatsapp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "audio_file": "/path/to/speech.wav",
    "phone_number_id": "PHONE_ID",
    "recipient": "+14155551234",
    "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }'
```

## 🔧 Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup instead of using `install.sh`:

```bash
cd ~/clawd/skills/qwen3-tts
bash scripts/setup_env.sh        # Detect GPU, create venv, install deps
bash scripts/start_server.sh     # Start the TTS server
bash scripts/health_check.sh     # Verify it's running
```

### Server Lifecycle

```bash
bash scripts/start_server.sh     # Start (idempotent — won't restart if already running)
bash scripts/stop_server.sh      # Gracefully stop
bash scripts/health_check.sh     # Returns OK or UNHEALTHY
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy the template and customize:

```bash
cp config.json.template config.json
```

The config file controls server settings, default model, audio output, voice storage, and messaging credentials. See [`config.json.template`](config.json.template) for all options.
