# Policy Lawyer

## Overview

`policy-lawyer` is built around the curated policy notebook at `references/policies.md`. The CLI (`scripts/policy_lawyer.py`) lets you:

- `--list-topics` to list every policy heading.
- `--topic <name>` to show the section that matches a topic (case-insensitive).
- `--keyword <term>` to search all policies for a given keyword.

Use this skill when you need to remind yourself of the community standards before drafting announcements or when a question lands that needs an authoritative policy quote.
