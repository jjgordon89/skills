## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.0] (2026-02-15) — Agent Intelligence Update

Major feature release focused on real-time intelligence, social graph tracking, AI-powered sentiment, and structured export formats. Designed to make xint the most capable X intelligence skill for AI agents.

### ✨ Added
- **`watch` command** — Real-time monitoring. Polls a search query on interval, shows only new tweets. Supports webhook POST (Slack, Discord, etc.), JSONL output for piping, graceful shutdown with session stats. Auto-handles rate limits.
- **`diff` command** — Follower/following tracking with local snapshots. Shows who followed/unfollowed since last check. Supports `--following` for tracking who you follow, `--history` to view all snapshots, `--json` for structured output.
- **`report` command** — Automated intelligence reports combining search + Grok AI analysis + optional sentiment. Generates markdown with executive summary, top tweets, per-account activity, and metadata. `--save` writes to `data/exports/`.
- **`--sentiment` flag** — AI-powered per-tweet sentiment analysis on search results via Grok. Shows positive/negative/neutral/mixed with scores (-1.0 to 1.0) and aggregate stats. Uses batched Grok calls with structured JSON parsing.
- **`--csv` flag** — CSV output for spreadsheet analysis. Proper escaping, header row, all tweet fields.
- **`--jsonl` flag** — One JSON object per line. Optimized for Unix pipelines: `xint search "topic" --jsonl | jq 'select(.metrics.likes > 100)'`
- **`data/snapshots/` directory** — Local storage for follower/following snapshots used by `diff` command.

### 🔧 Changed
- **README rewritten** — Hero image, agent-first positioning, feature table, all new commands documented, "Use as an AI Agent Skill" section expanded.
- **Commands table expanded** — 25 commands total (was 21), with shortcuts for `watch` (`w`), `diff` (also `followers`).
- **Usage text updated** — All new commands and flags documented in `--help`.
- **Cost tracking** — Added `followers` and `following_list` cost rates.

- **Following** — `following [username]` to list accounts you follow
- **Trending topics** — `trends [location]` with 30+ countries, API + search fallback
- **Grok AI analysis** — `analyze` command powered by xAI (grok-3, grok-3-mini, grok-2)
- **Cost management** — per-call tracking, daily budgets, weekly/monthly reports

### Changed
- **Renamed** `x-search.ts` to `xint.ts`, `x-research` to `xint` throughout
- **Generalized env paths** — no more hardcoded server paths; reads from `.env` at project root
- **Save location** — `--save` now writes to `data/exports/` (was `data/exports/`)
- **Community-ready README** — badges, command table, OAuth guide, Grok docs, cost reference

### Removed
- Hardcoded paths to `/home/openclaw/`, `~/.config/env/global.env`, `~/.openclaw/.env`
- Personal usernames and server-specific references

## [2.3.0] (2026-02-09)

### 🔒 Security
- **Purged all stale tier/subscription references** across 6 files (13 instances of "Basic tier", "current tier", "enterprise-only" etc.) — LLM hallucination fix
- **Security section in README** — Documents bearer token exposure risk when running inside AI coding agents with session logging

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Tweet truncation bug** — `tweet` and `thread` commands now show full tweet text instead of cutting off at 200 characters. Search results still truncate for readability. (h/t @sergeykarayev)

### ✨ Added
- **Full-archive search** (`/2/tweets/search/all`) is available on pay-per-use — not enterprise-only as LLMs commonly claim
- **Updated rate limits** — old per-15-min caps replaced by spending limits in Developer Console
- **Clarified 7-day limit** — is a skill limitation (using recent search endpoint), not an API restriction
- **Query length limits** — 512 chars (recent), 1024 (full-archive), 4096 (enterprise)
- **Per-resource cost breakdown** — $0.005/post read, $0.010/user lookup, $0.010/post create
- **24-hour deduplication** docs, xAI credit bonus tiers, usage monitoring endpoint

## [2.2.0] (2026-02-08)

### ✨ Added
- **`--quick` mode** — Smarter, cheaper searches. Single page, auto noise filtering (`-is:retweet -is:reply`), 1hr cache TTL. Designed for fast pulse checks.
- **`--from <username>`** — Shorthand for `from:username` queries. `search "topic" --from username` instead of typing the full operator.
- **`--quality` flag** — Filters out low-engagement tweets (≥10 likes). Applied post-fetch since `min_faves` operator isn't available via the API.
- **Cost display on all searches** — Every search now shows estimated API cost: `📊 N tweets read · est. cost ~$X`

### 🔧 Changed
- README cleaned up — removed duplicate cost section, added Quick Mode and Cost docs
- Cache supports variable TTL (1hr in quick mode, 15min default)

---

## [2.1.0] (2026-02-08)

### ✨ Added
- **`--since` time filter** — search only recent tweets: `--since 1h`, `--since 3h`, `--since 30m`, `--since 1d`
  - Accepts shorthand (`1h`, `30m`, `2d`) or ISO 8601 timestamps
  - Great for monitoring during catalysts or checking what just dropped
- Minutes support (`30m`, `15m`) in addition to hours and days
- Cache keys now include time filter to prevent stale results across different time ranges

---

## [2.0.0] (2026-02-08)

### ✨ Added
- **`x-search.ts` CLI** — Bun script wrapping the X API. No more inline curl/python one-liners.
  - `search` — query with auto noise filtering, engagement sorting, pagination
  - `profile` — recent tweets from any user
  - `thread` — full conversation thread by tweet ID
  - `tweet` — single tweet lookup
  - `watchlist` — manage accounts to monitor, batch-check recent activity
  - `cache clear` — manage result cache
- **`lib/api.ts`** — Typed X API wrapper with search, thread, profile, tweet lookup, engagement filtering, deduplication
- **`lib/cache.ts`** — File-based cache with 15-minute TTL. Avoids re-fetching identical queries.
- **`lib/format.ts`** — Output formatters for Telegram (mobile-friendly) and markdown (research docs)
- **Watchlist system** — `data/watchlist.json` for monitoring accounts. Useful for heartbeat integration.
- **Auto noise filtering** — `-is:retweet` added by default unless already in query
- **Engagement sorting** — `--sort likes|impressions|retweets|recent`
- **Post-hoc filtering** — `--min-likes N` and `--min-impressions N` (since X API doesn't support these as search operators)
- **Save to file** — `--save` flag auto-saves research to `data/exports/`
- **Multiple output formats** — `--json` for raw data, `--markdown` for research docs, default for Telegram

### 🔧 Changed
- **SKILL.md** rewritten to reference CLI tooling. Research loop instructions preserved and updated.
- **README.md** expanded with full install, setup, usage, and API cost documentation.

### How it compares to v1
- v1 was a prompt-only skill — Claude assembled raw curl commands with inline Python parsers each time
- v2 wraps everything in typed Bun scripts — faster execution, cleaner output, fewer context tokens burned on boilerplate
- Same agentic research loop, same X API, just better tooling underneath

## [1.0.0] (2026-02-08)

### ✨ Added
- Initial release
- SKILL.md with agentic research loop (decompose → search → refine → follow threads → deep-dive → synthesize)
- `references/x-api.md` with full X API endpoint reference
- Search operators, pagination, thread following, linked content deep-diving
