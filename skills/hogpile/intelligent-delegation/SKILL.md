# Intelligent Delegation Framework

A practical implementation of concepts from [Intelligent AI Delegation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11865) (Google DeepMind, Feb 2026) for OpenClaw agents.

## The Problem

When AI agents delegate tasks to sub-agents, common failure modes include:
- **Lost tasks** — background work completes silently, no follow-up
- **Blind trust** — passing through sub-agent output without verification
- **No learning** — repeating the same delegation mistakes
- **Brittle failure** — one error kills the whole workflow
- **Gut-feel routing** — no systematic way to choose which agent handles what

## The Solution: 5 Phases

### Phase 1: Task Tracking & Scheduled Checks

**Problem:** "I'll ping you when it's done" → never happens.

**Solution:** 
1. Create a `TASKS.md` file to log all background work
2. For every background task, schedule a one-shot cron job to check on completion
3. Update your `HEARTBEAT.md` to check `TASKS.md` first

**TASKS.md template:**
```markdown
# Active Tasks

### [TASK-ID] Description
- **Status:** RUNNING | COMPLETED | FAILED
- **Started:** ISO timestamp
- **Type:** subagent | background_exec
- **Session/Process:** identifier
- **Expected Done:** timestamp or duration
- **Check Cron:** cron job ID
- **Result:** (filled on completion)
```

**Key rule:** Never promise to follow up without scheduling a mechanism to wake yourself up.

### Phase 2: Sub-Agent Performance Tracking

**Problem:** No memory of which agents succeed or fail at which tasks.

**Solution:** Create `memory/agent-performance.md` to track:
- Success rate per agent
- Quality scores (1-5) per task
- Known failure modes
- "Best for" / "Avoid for" heuristics

**After every delegation:**
1. Log the outcome (success/partial/failed/crashed)
2. Note runtime and token cost
3. Record lessons learned

**Before every delegation:**
1. Check if this agent has failed on similar tasks
2. Consult the "decision heuristics" section

Example entry:
```markdown
#### 2026-02-16 | data-extraction | CRASHED
- **Task:** Extract data from 5,000-row CSV
- **Outcome:** Context overflow
- **Lesson:** Never feed large raw data to LLM agents. Write a script instead.
```

---

### Phase 3: Task Contracts & Automated Verification

**Problem:** Vague prompts → unpredictable output → manual checking.

**Solution:**
1. Define formal contracts before delegating (expected output, success criteria)
2. Run automated checks on completion

**Contract schema:**
```markdown
- **Delegatee:** which agent
- **Expected Output:** type, location, format
- **Success Criteria:** machine-checkable conditions
- **Constraints:** timeout, scope, data sensitivity
- **Fallback:** what to do if it fails
```

**Verification tool** (`tools/verify_task.py`):
```bash
# Check if output file exists
python3 verify_task.py --check file_exists --path /output/file.json

# Validate JSON structure
python3 verify_task.py --check valid_json --path /output/file.json

# Check database row count
python3 verify_task.py --check sqlite_rows --path /db.sqlite --table items --min 100

# Check if service is running
python3 verify_task.py --check port_alive --port 8080

# Run multiple checks from a manifest
python3 verify_task.py --check all --manifest /checks.json
```

See `tools/verify_task.py` in this skill for the full implementation.

### Phase 4: Adaptive Re-routing (Fallback Chains)

**Problem:** Task fails → report failure → give up.

**Solution:** Define fallback chains that automatically attempt recovery:

```
1. First agent attempt
   ↓ on failure (diagnose root cause)
2. Retry same agent with adjusted parameters
   ↓ on failure
3. Try different agent
   ↓ on failure
4. Fall back to script (for data tasks)
   ↓ on failure
5. Main agent handles directly
   ↓ on failure
6. ESCALATE to human with full context
```

**Diagnosis guide:**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Response |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Context overflow | Input too large | Use script instead |
| Timeout | Task too complex | Decompose further |
| Empty output | Lost track of goal | Retry with tighter prompt |
| Wrong format | Ambiguous spec | Retry with explicit example |

**When to escalate to human:**
- All fallback options exhausted
- Irreversible actions (emails, transactions)
- Ambiguity that can't be resolved programmatically

---

### Phase 5: Multi-Axis Task Scoring

**Problem:** Choosing agents by gut feel.

**Solution:** Score tasks on 7 axes (from the paper) to systematically determine:
- Which agent to use
- Autonomy level (atomic / bounded / open-ended)
- Monitoring frequency
- Whether human approval is required

**The 7 axes (1-5 scale):**
1. **Complexity** — steps / reasoning required
2. **Criticality** — consequences of failure
3. **Cost** — expected compute expense
4. **Reversibility** — can effects be undone (1=yes, 5=no)
5. **Verifiability** — ease of checking output (1=auto, 5=human judgment)
6. **Contextuality** — sensitive data involved
7. **Subjectivity** — objective vs preference-based

**Quick heuristics (for obvious cases):**
- Low complexity + low criticality → cheapest agent, minimal monitoring
- High criticality OR irreversible → human approval required
- High subjectivity → iterative feedback, not one-shot
- Large data → script, not LLM agent

See `tools/score_task.py` for a scoring tool implementation.

## Integration with AGENTS.md

Add this to your `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Delegation Protocol
1. Log to TASKS.md
2. Schedule a check cron
3. Verify output with verify_task.py
4. Report results
5. Never promise follow-up without a mechanism
6. Handle failures with fallback chains
```

## Integration with HEARTBEAT.md

Add as the first check:

```markdown
## 0. Active Task Monitor (CHECK FIRST)
- Read TASKS.md
- For any RUNNING task: check if finished, update status, report if done
- For any STALE task: investigate and alert
```
