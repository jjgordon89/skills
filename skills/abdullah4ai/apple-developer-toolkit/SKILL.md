# Apple Developer Toolkit

Three tools in one skill. Each part works independently with different credential requirements.

## Credential Requirements by Feature

| Feature | Credentials Needed | Works Without Setup |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Documentation Search (Part 1) | None | Yes |
| App Store Connect (Part 2) | App Store Connect API key (.p8) | No |
| iOS App Builder (Part 3) | LLM API key + Xcode | No |

## Setup

### Part 1: Documentation Search (no setup needed)

Works immediately with Node.js:

```bash
node cli.js search "NavigationStack"
```

### Part 2: App Store Connect CLI

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap Abdullah4AI/tap && brew install appstore
```

Authenticate with your App Store Connect API key:

```bash
appstore auth login --name "MyApp" --key-id "KEY_ID" --issuer-id "ISSUER_ID" --private-key /path/to/AuthKey.p8
```

Or set environment variables:

```bash
export APPSTORE_KEY_ID="your-key-id"
export APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID="your-issuer-id"
export APPSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="/path/to/AuthKey.p8"
```

API keys are created at https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api

### Part 3: iOS App Builder

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap Abdullah4AI/tap && brew install swiftship
```

Prerequisites: Xcode (with iOS Simulator), XcodeGen, and an LLM API key for code generation.

```bash
swiftship setup    # Checks and installs prerequisites
```

### All-in-one setup script

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

This script shows what will be installed, asks for confirmation, then installs both CLIs. It does not install Xcode or configure API keys. Pass `--yes` to skip the confirmation prompt.

### Trust & Provenance

Both CLIs are installed via Homebrew from the `Abdullah4AI/tap` third-party tap. Source code is open and available for review before installation:

| Binary | Source | Tap Formula |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `appstore` | [github.com/Abdullah4AI/appstore](https://github.com/Abdullah4AI/appstore) | [homebrew-tap/appstore.rb](https://github.com/Abdullah4AI/homebrew-tap) |
| `swiftship` | [github.com/Abdullah4AI/swiftship](https://github.com/Abdullah4AI/swiftship) | [homebrew-tap/swiftship.rb](https://github.com/Abdullah4AI/homebrew-tap) |

To verify before installing, inspect the tap formulas:
```bash
brew tap Abdullah4AI/tap
brew cat Abdullah4AI/tap/appstore
brew cat Abdullah4AI/tap/swiftship
```

## Part 1: Documentation Search

```bash
node cli.js search "NavigationStack"
node cli.js symbols "UIView"
node cli.js doc "/documentation/swiftui/navigationstack"
node cli.js overview "SwiftUI"
node cli.js samples "SwiftUI"
node cli.js wwdc-search "concurrency"
node cli.js wwdc-year 2025
node cli.js wwdc-topic "swiftui-ui-frameworks"
```

## Part 2: App Store Connect

| Upload build | `appstore builds upload --app "APP_ID" --ipa "app.ipa" --wait` |
| Publish TestFlight | `appstore publish testflight --app "APP_ID" --ipa "app.ipa" --group "Beta" --wait` |
| Submit App Store | `appstore publish appstore --app "APP_ID" --ipa "app.ipa" --submit --confirm --wait` |
| List certificates | `appstore certificates list` |

| Notarize | `appstore notarization submit --file ./MyApp.zip --wait` |
| Validate | `appstore validate --app "APP_ID" --version-id "VERSION_ID" --strict` |
| Status dashboard | `appstore status --app "APP_ID" --output table` |
| Weekly insights | `appstore insights weekly --app "APP_ID" --source analytics` |
| Metadata pull | `appstore metadata pull --app "APP_ID" --version "1.2.3" --dir ./metadata` |
| Release notes | `appstore release-notes generate --since-tag "v1.2.2"` |
| Diff localizations | `appstore diff localizations --app "APP_ID" --path ./metadata` |
| Nominations | `appstore nominations create --app "APP_ID" --name "Launch"` |

### Environment Variables

All environment variables are optional. They override flags when set.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `APPSTORE_KEY_ID` | API Key ID |
| `APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID` | API Issuer ID |
| `APPSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` | Path to .p8 key file |
| `APPSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY` | Raw private key string |
| `APPSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` | Base64-encoded private key |
| `APPSTORE_APP_ID` | Default app ID |
| `APPSTORE_PROFILE` | Default auth profile |
| `APPSTORE_DEBUG` | Enable debug output |
| `APPSTORE_TIMEOUT` | Request timeout |
| `APPSTORE_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN` | Skip system keychain |

Covers: TestFlight, Builds, Signing, Subscriptions, IAP, Analytics, Finance, Xcode Cloud, Notarization, Game Center, Webhooks (with local receiver), App Clips, Screenshots (local capture/frame/review workflow), Workflow automation, Metadata (pull/push/validate), Diff, Status Dashboard, Insights, Release Notes, Pricing, Pre-orders, Accessibility, Nominations, Product Pages, Win-back Offers, Promoted Purchases, Marketplace, Android-iOS Mapping, Migrate (Fastlane).

## Part 3: iOS App Builder

Build complete iOS apps from natural language descriptions using AI-powered code generation.

```bash
swiftship              # Interactive mode
swiftship setup        # Install prerequisites (Xcode, XcodeGen, AI backend)
swiftship fix          # Auto-fix build errors
swiftship run          # Build and launch in simulator
swiftship info         # Show project status
swiftship usage        # Token usage and cost
```

### How it works

```
describe → analyze → plan → build → fix → run
```

1. **Analyze** - Extracts app name, features, core flow from description
2. **Plan** - Produces file-level build plan: data models, navigation, design
3. **Build** - Generates Swift source files, project.yml, asset catalog
4. **Fix** - Compiles and auto-repairs until build succeeds
5. **Run** - Boots iOS Simulator and launches the app

### Interactive commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/run` | Build and launch in simulator |
| `/fix` | Auto-fix compilation errors |
| `/open` | Open project in Xcode |
| `/model [name]` | Switch model (sonnet, opus, haiku) |
| `/info` | Show project info |
| `/usage` | Token usage and cost |
