# Templates & Tone Guide

## Goal
Create a comprehensive, detailed draft that captures **ALL key insights** from the provided references. Do not summarize briefly; expand on each point with evidence and context from the source material.

## Structure & Format
Organize the draft with clear, descriptive headlines for each major keypoint or theme found in the references.

### Headline Usage
- Use `## Headline` for main sections.
- Use `### Sub-headline` for detailed breakdowns within a section.
- Headlines should be active and descriptive (e.g., "The Paradox of Digital Entropy" instead of just "Entropy").

## Content Requirements
1.  **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure every distinct point, argument, and piece of evidence from the references is included.
2.  **Detail Optimization**: Be detailed but not verbose. Use precise language to explain complex ideas fully without fluff.
3.  **Synthesis**: Connect ideas between different references where applicable, but maintain the integrity of the original points. When writing a keypoint that is derived from a note, always include use the format `[[note_title]]`. This is **very important** for a brainstorming note to trace ideas back to original references.
4.  **Reflections**: Add your own reflections on the topic.
5.  **References**: Always include a `## References` section at the end of the draft, listing all the notes that were referenced in the draft.

## Tone
- **Authoritative yet Curious**: Write with confidence but remain open to the nuances of the topics.
- **Clarity First**: Prioritize clear explanation of concepts over stylistic flourishes, but maintain a flow that is engaging to read.

## Append format
Always append under `## 🧠 Brainstorming (YYYY-MM-DD)` with a provenance line.

## References
**Always** include a `## References` section at the end of the draft, listing all the notes that were referenced in the draft.
This is **very important** and is the whole point of the zettelkasten exercise.
