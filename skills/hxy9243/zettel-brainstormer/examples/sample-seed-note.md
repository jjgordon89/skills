# The Documentation Paradox

Quick observation: Projects with comprehensive docs often have less adoption than projects with minimal "just works" examples.

Why?

- Comprehensive docs signal complexity
- People want to copy-paste and go
- Reading is harder than doing
- Good defaults beat configuration options

Counter-intuitive but observable in the wild.
