# YouTube Ultimate

**Your agent reads YouTube so you don't have to.** Pull transcripts, summarize videos, and extract knowledge — all without touching YouTube's API quota.

## What It Does

- **Free Transcripts** — Grab any video's transcript instantly. No API key, no quota, no billing surprises at 3 AM. Won't burn through your free-tier quota fetching a single playlist, then suggest you upgrade to the $200/month plan like it's doing you a favor.
- **4K Video Downloads** — Save videos locally for offline access, training data, or that flight where Wi-Fi costs more than the ticket.
- **Video Exploration** — Search, browse, and drill into video details without rate-limit anxiety.

## Why It Matters

YouTube's API gives you 10,000 quota units per day. A single search costs 100. A transcript request? Not even supported. YouTube Ultimate sidesteps all of that. Your agent gets full access to video content while your quota counter stays at zero.

*Clone it. Fork it. Break it. Make it yours.*
