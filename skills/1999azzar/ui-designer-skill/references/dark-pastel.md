# Dark Pastel Aesthetics

A combination of deep backgrounds and soft, low-saturation pastel colors for a sophisticated yet approachable look.

## Color Palette Strategy
- **Background**: Deep grays or tinted blacks (e.g., `#121212`, `#1A1B1E`).
- **Accent Colors**: Soft mint (`#B2F2BB`), lavender (`#E5DBFF`), pastel blue (`#D0EBFF`), and salmon (`#FFD8D8`).
- **Surface**: Slightly lighter than the background (`#1E1E24`).

## Typography
- **Headlines**: Semi-bold with generous letter spacing.
- **Body**: High readability, slightly off-white (`#E8E8E8`) to reduce eye strain.

## Best Practices
- Use pastels only for primary actions or highlights.
- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for accessibility.
- Works perfectly with **Minimalism** and **Glassmorphism**.
