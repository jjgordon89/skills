# Material You (Material 3) Principles

Material You focuses on personalization, adaptive shapes, and expressive motion.

## Core Features
- **Large Corner Radii**: Buttons and cards typically use `rounded-3xl` or fully rounded shapes.
- **Dynamic Color**: Use a seed color to generate a palette (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Surface).
- **Surface Elevation**: Use color tints (tonal palettes) instead of heavy shadows to indicate elevation.
- **Minimalist Iconography**: Simple, stroke-based icons.

## Component Patterns
- **Cards**: Flat or slightly tinted background with high corner radius.
- **Buttons**: Pill-shaped (fully rounded) with filled or tonal backgrounds.
- **Typography**: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Roboto, Inter, or Product Sans).

## Interaction
- Focus on "state" changes (hover, pressed) through subtle opacity shifts or tonal changes.
