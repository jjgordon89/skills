# Minimalist Design Principles

"Less is more." Focus on essential elements, high-quality typography, and purposeful whitespace.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Whitespace (Negative Space)
- Don't be afraid of empty space. It directs attention.
- Use generous margins and padding (`p-8`, `m-12`).

### 2. Typography-First
- Let the font do the heavy lifting.
- Use a clear hierarchy: One bold Sans-Serif for headings, a highly readable Serif or Sans-Serif for body.
- Limit the number of font weights and sizes.

### 3. Purposeful Color
- Use a neutral base (white, off-white, or very dark grey).
- Use a single accent color for calls to action.

### 4. Remove Non-Essentials
- Ditch unnecessary borders and shadows. Use subtle contrast or spacing to separate sections.

## Tailwind CSS Implementation

```html
<section class="max-w-2xl mx-auto py-20 px-6">
  <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-8">Elegance in Simplicity.</h1>
  <p class="text-xl text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
    Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
  </p>
</section>
```

## Usage in Skill
When asked for Minimalist design:
- Simplify layouts to a single column or a very clean grid.
- Suggest "Zinc" or "Slate" palettes.
- Prioritize high-contrast typography.
