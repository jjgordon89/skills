## What problem does this solve

<!-- Be specific. What fails or is missing today? -->

## Proposed solution

<!-- How would you implement it? Include pseudocode or examples if helpful -->

## Security implications

<!-- Does this change the firewall policy? Could it weaken rollback guarantees? Does it add sudo calls? -->

## Alternatives considered

<!-- What else did you think about? Why is your approach better? -->

## Checklist

- [ ] This does not weaken rollback or lockout detection
- [ ] This works with `--dry-run` as the default
- [ ] This passes `shellcheck`
- [ ] New providers (if any) are justified
