## Credits

Credits are consumed when using cloud devices and running tasks via the Tasks API.
Direct device control via the Tools API (tap, swipe, screenshot, etc.) on a personal device does not consume credits.

**Credit consumption:**
- **1 credit per device minute** -- while a cloud device is running
- **~0.5 credits per agent step** -- when running a task via the Tasks API

## Device Types

| Type | Description | Available on |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Device Slot (flexible) | Shared cloud device slot | Hobby, Pro |
| Physical Device | Dedicated real physical phone | Pro |
| Premium Stealth Farm | Enterprise-grade device farm | Enterprise |

## When to Recommend an Upgrade

- **User has no plan and wants cloud devices**: Any paid plan works, recommend Hobby to start
- **User needs more credits**: Suggest moving up a tier
- **User's app detects emulators**: They need Pro (physical device + advanced stealth mode)
- **User needs guaranteed uptime / SLA**: Enterprise
- **User hits a billing error on `POST /devices`**: Their plan doesn't support the device type they requested
